/*
  Abstraction:
   -> Implementation Hiding
   -> Hiding All unnecessary details & Showing only the important parts
   -> We can Implement Abstraction by using Access Modifier
       . Private
       . Public
       . Protected


  Data Hiding Vs Abstraction
   -> data Hiding only hide the data
   -> Abstraction hiding the un-useful data and showing the important data 

  Way of Implementation Abstraction
   ->  We can Implement Abstraction by using Access Modifier
       . Private
       . Public
       . Protected
   -> By Using Abstract Classes

  Advantages:

   -> Only you can make changes in to your data and no one else can
   -> It makes the application secure by not allowing anyone else to see the background details 
   -> Increase the reuseability of the code 
   -> Avoid duplication of your code
